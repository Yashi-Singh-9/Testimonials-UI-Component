### HTML
- The `index.html` file contains the structure of the testimonial section and integrates the testimonials, header, and navigation buttons.

### LESS (CSS)
- The `style.less` file contains the styles for the testimonial component, including:
    - Color variables for a modern design.
    - Nesting of selectors for better readability and maintainability.
    - Media queries for responsiveness across different devices.

### JavaScript
- The `script.js` file contains the logic for the testimonial slider:
    - It updates the position of the testimonials based on the index.
    - Event listeners for the left and right buttons allow users to navigate through testimonials.

### Images
- The `images/` folder contains the profile pictures for the authors of the testimonials.

## Responsiveness

This component is designed to work across a variety of screen sizes:
- On larger screens, the testimonials are displayed side by side in a horizontal layout.
- On smaller screens, the testimonials stack vertically, and the slider adjusts to fit smaller screen widths.

The media queries ensure that the layout is fluid and responsive, providing a seamless experience for mobile and tablet users.

## How to Use

1. **Navigation**: Use the left and right arrow buttons to navigate through the testimonials.
2. **Responsive**: Resize your browser window to see how the component adjusts on different screen sizes.
3. **Adding More Testimonials**: You can easily add more testimonials by copying the structure of the existing `.testimonial-card` divs and updating the content.
